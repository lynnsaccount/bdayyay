    <h1>SOME REVIEWS OF STEF</h1>
</header>
<h4>"My toaster burnt out the other day so I headed over to akatsuki to search for another one. Was kindly greeted by a man named stef. I told him I was looking for a new toaster for my home. He picked out a water-proof toaster for me! YA! I couldn't believe it either. Can't wait to try it out in my bathtub! Thanks again stef. :)"-mike</h4>

<h4>"I recently visited akatsuki in search of a new dryer because my old one wasn't drying my clothes all of the way. I walked in and was immediately greeted by a worker named stef. stef was incredibly helpful and I explained my situation to him. He looked me dead in the eyes, didn't say a word, and grabbed me by the hand and led me into the back. He grabbed a hose and completely drenched me from head to toe, and aggressively shoved me in a dryer and hit start. I tumbled around in there for somewhere close to an hour. When the cycle was over, stef let me out and I was absolutely bone dry. I was so impressed with the service that I bought 3 dryers, and gifted them to two of my friends. I will definitely be coming back just because of stef!"-lynn</h4>

 <h4>"I'm a veteran of Vietnam... I stumbled into akatsuki after I had a crazy episode in the parking. lot. An employee named stef brought me in and redesigned the entire store to look like the jungles of Vietnam. He went as far as dressing like a Vietcong and allowed me to tackle him and ease my PTSD. I'm now cured. Ive struggled with my PTSD since 1975. Better than any doctor I've ever visited. Will be back. Thank you stef."-max</h4>
